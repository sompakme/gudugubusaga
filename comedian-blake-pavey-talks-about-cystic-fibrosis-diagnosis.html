There’s actually a lot of good things that come from it, you know, like having a midlife crisis in tandem with my own father, so that’s something we can always bond over.”</p><p>But Blake joked he didn’t exactly have the financial freedom he would like for a midlife crisis.</p><p>“You’re watching the movie [where] the bloke’s going through his midlife crisis so he’ll get a Ferrari or a Lambo, splash out on a boat. I can’t do that sort of stuff,” he said.</p><p>“Best I could do – 2001 Toyota Camry from Croydon car sales that mum chipped in for. It’s just not a sexy car to drive around in. Doesn’t really scream out, ‘This man’s living on the edge.’ It just sort of politely announces that I’m not doing as well as I thought I would coming out of high school.”</p><p>At the end of the day, Blake feels like every other 20-year-old and jokes most of his friends probably wouldn’t die too long after him due to the state of the world.</p><p>He said writing material about his diagnosis wasn’t a conscious decision.</p><p>“I guess, in hindsight, it’s pretty cathartic to be able to talk about it on stage and spread awareness that way,” Blake said.</p><p>“But, I never really sort of thought about, you know, meticulously sitting down one day and writing a whole bunch of CF-based material. I think it was just sort of a subconscious way of saying, ‘OK, how can I separate myself from, you know, the 50,000 other comedians?’</p><p>“I guess it’s just something that makes my comedy unique, I think, I and it also just goes back to writing what you know.”</p><p>He said audiences take the comedy well as it’s about him, and he isn’t punching up or down at anyone.</p><p>But, that hasn’t stopped people heckling him.</p><p>Blake is currently opening for mate Luke Kidgell’s Cheers to That tour, with Blake plugging his own show at the end of his set.</p><p>“I didn’t even finish saying the tour was next year before some bloke yelled out, ‘If you even make it,’” he said.</p><p>One of Blake’s most told stories was meeting actor and WWE star John Cena through the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>It was delayed a couple of years because of scheduling issues and Cena having an injury but, when it finally happened, Blake was only given 10 minutes before the show started.</p><p>He said: “I was quite nervous. I was quite fidgety and I was rushing through all of my questions, and he could sense that so he literally just grabbed me on the shoulder and he said take as much time as you need. I do not care if the show starts late. So that was massive.”</p><p>Now, Blake is just excited to kickstart his own tour.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme9GemKVlnJ6zpnvNnq6sZZyes6Z7wpqroZmiqbakecKopJ6cmZa7brvPnqWsZaWleqKuzq6rZpupqMGqr4yfoJuqn6i2tHvNnq6sZaOpvLPFjp6Zamlgm4F0r5Wamp1xZ5aEpX%2BXm3Cca5FpsKd%2Fk25t</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./emmy-winning-and-trailblazing-producer-was-90.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emmy-Winning and Trailblazing Producer Was 90">&larr;
