He is a very flexible unit because of the hydro element and he can fit really well in various team comps such as Vape, Permafreeze, and Taser comps.<h2>Is Ayato strong Genshin?</h2>As with most characters in the game, you should pull if you want the character. Coming from a meta perspective, it's safe to say that Ayato is a strong character. He's well equipped to tackle the Spiral Abyss, and his teams are both strong and fun to play.<h2>Can Ayato be sub DPS?</h2>After casting Ayato's Elemental Burst, Normal Attacks of any characters within the field will deal increased DMG. Given how long the burst duration is, it is possible to use it as a Sub-DPS tool if Ayato's Elemental skill is still in cooldown.<h2>Who is the strongest DPS in Genshin?</h2>DILUC. Diluc used to be considered one of the best DPS characters thanks to his impressive base attack power and high critical rate. His elemental abilities are capable of dealing devastating Pyro damage, while being perfect for elemental reactions.<h2>AYATO IS ALMOST PERFECT! C0 Ayato Showcase - Best Build, Teams, Weapons (Genshin Impact)</h2><p></p><h2>Who is stronger Xiao or Diluc?</h2>In terms of attack speed, Xiao surpasses Diluc, as Claymore wielding characters have slower attacking speed compared to other weapon carriers. Polearm users can dish out multiple hits per second, whereas claymore users are usually slower because of the heavy weapon mechanism.<h2>Who is the best 5 star DPS?</h2><p>Genshin Impact: All 20 5-Star Characters, Ranked By Power</p><ul><li>8 Xiao.</li><li>7 Ayaka.</li><li>6 Venti.</li><li>5 Kazuha.</li><li>4 Zhongli.</li><li>3 Hu Tao.</li><li>2 Eula.</li><li>1 Ganyu.</li></ul><h2>Is Ayato a hyper carry?</h2>Granted, there's actually no tension or bad blood between the two Kamisato siblings in Genshin Impact. It's just that both Ayato and Ayaka are in the same tier and compete for mostly the same role in the game. That would be "hypercarry," which is the main damage dealer (or main character) in a party.<h2>Is Yae Miko a DPS?</h2>Yae Miko can work as either a Main DPS or a Sub-DPS, though she does need another Electro character on her to be able to Burst continously. Currently, she's great for Taser comps and is a viable Superconduct Support character.<h2>What tier is Ayato?</h2>Character Tier List 2.6 (May 2022) | Ayato & Ayaka Tier. Try Our Artifact Score & Rating Tool Here!<h2>Should I pull Ayato or Venti?</h2>Our advice for you is to pull for whichever unit you feel your account needs more. Venti and Ayato are both great characters that can make your account much more complete. While they are both good pulls, neither is a required meta unit.<h2>Which is better Venti or Ayato?</h2>In the 2.6 update, players should go for Venti only if they love the character as he has quite lost his viability in the current patch. In the comparison of Genshin Impact Ayato vs Venti, we suggest players to go for Ayato as he might prove to be the best Hydro DPS character in the game.<h2>Does Ayato worth pulling?</h2>Taking into account all that we said above, as well as all the leaks and other information revealed about the character, Kamisato Ayato is a sure pull for all of those who are currently looking for a Hydro DPS, as he is capable of dealing massive damage, thanks to his Elemental Skill.<h2>Is Ayato DPS or sub DPS?</h2>Ayato's kit is well-rounded, and the number of Kamisato Ayato builds should be both varied and viable. While he can be played as a sub-DPS, however, many players will want to keep him on-field as a main DPS to enjoy his incredible attack animations and style.<h2>What does Ayato scale off of?</h2>This weapon is surprisingly amazing for a general use Ayato, thanks to its universal ATK boost that scales off of HP. It also has a massive 44.1% Crit Rate, which makes it easier to stack more Crit DMG.<h2>Is Ningguang a good DPS?</h2>In Genshin Impact, Ningguang works best as a main DPS character. Our guide outlines the best weapons and artifacts for the four-star geo character, and also provides details on every item you need to reach ascension level six.<h2>Is Raiden a DPS?</h2>Raiden Shogun is the most powerful Electro Main DPS in Genshin Impact at the moment. Raiden Shogun Main DPS Build is mostly used by travelers. Her Elemental Burst can dish out explosive damage.<h2>Will Scaramouche be playable?</h2>What do we know so far about Genshin Impact Scaramouche? Scaramouche is an upcoming playable character in Mihoyo's massive open-world game, though he's also shrouded in mystery. The self-proclaimed wanderer from Inazuma first appeared during an early in-game event in 2020 and established himself as an antagonist.<h2>Is Ayaka good with Ayato?</h2>Now that he's in Genshin Impact, it's incredibly satisfying to see how well Ayato and Ayaka work together. To start, Cryo and Hydro are two elements that work well together. The Elemental Reaction between the two will freeze characters.<h2>Is Kaeya a good DPS?</h2>Kaeya stands right now as one of the best Sub-DPS in the game. This is because of his Elemental Burst that can easily work with other characters due to its ease of use and overall value.<h2>What is Xiao and Venti relationship?</h2>Even though they are connected to different regions, Venti and Xiao share a very sweet connection. Xiao almost died one night due to his negative karma but was saved by the sound of Venti playing his flute. The song was so calming that it pulled Xiao back to his senses and returned his strength.<h2>Is Ayaka DPS a Genshin?</h2>Elemental Burst – Kamisato Art: Soumetsu<p>Ayaka's burst is the money maker of her kit. It's the reason Ayaka is a powerful Main DPS. This summons a whirlwind that continuously deals Cryo damage. This burst deals an extremely high amount of damage, and is the main source of damage for Ayaka.</p><h2>Is Xiao a DPS?</h2>Is Xiao a DPS character? Absolutely, to the exclusion of almost everything else. Xiao has high base attack, and his Elemental Skill and Burst are both focused on dealing damage.<h2>How is Xiao a selfish DPS?</h2>With that said, there is a perk to Xiao being a selfish DPS. He plays like Razor where he needs to be out in the field more than 90 percent of the time. Compared to Diluc, Xiao is more independent when it comes to dealing damage. He doesn't need an elaborate character swapping sequence.<h2>Is Diluc still the best DPS?</h2>Diluc is still a great damage dealer in Genshin Impact<p>The main reason that Diluc will always be a reliable character is that he belongs to the Pyro element. Furthermore, Pyro is the best element in the game currently as it triggers Melt and Vaporize elemental reactions which have the highest damage scaling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZJqxkam8brDPrGSgnZ6otaq6</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kylie-skin-set-review-kylie-jenner-skin-care-products-before-and-after.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kylie Skin Set Review - Kylie Jenner Skin Care Products Before and After">&larr;
