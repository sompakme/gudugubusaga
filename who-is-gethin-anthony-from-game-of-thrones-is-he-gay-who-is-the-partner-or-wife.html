Anthony was born on October 9, 1983 in Warwickshire, England.&nbsp;He attended Ashton Hayes Primary School and Christ Church Primary School in New Malden, Surrey.</span></p><p><span>Anthony attended the prestigious Tiffin School in Kingston-upon-Thames, where he served as Head Boy.&nbsp;Soon after, he received a scholarship to the British American Drama Academy in London from July to August 2004. Gethin then studied English literature at Balliol College, Oxford University and was President of the Oxford University Dramatic Society London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts.</span></p><p><span>Although Gethin is best known for his role in&nbsp;</span><span>Game of Thrones,</span><span>&nbsp;his acting career dates back to 2006 when he made his Berlin debut in&nbsp;</span><span>Pinochet’s Last Stand;&nbsp;a</span><span>&nbsp;film about the life of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.&nbsp;In the film, Gethin played the role of William Straw.&nbsp;After his role in&nbsp;</span><span>Pinochet’s Last Stand</span><span>&nbsp;, Gethin has also appeared in&nbsp;</span><span>Beyond the Rave</span><span>&nbsp;(2008),&nbsp;</span><span>Into the Storm</span><span>&nbsp;(2009),&nbsp;</span><span>Dirt</span><span>&nbsp;(2012),&nbsp;</span><span>Copenhagen</span><span>&nbsp;(2012),&nbsp;</span><span>First Kill</span><span>&nbsp;(2017) and&nbsp;</span><span>Kodachrome</span><span>&nbsp;(2017).</span></p><p><span>From November 2012 to March 2013 Gethin played Grigory in Boris Godunov at the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon.&nbsp;He has appeared in&nbsp;</span><span>Ten Days to the War</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Doctors</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;However, his glory days were in 2011 and 2012 when he appeared as Renly Baratheon on the TV series Game of Thrones and Charles Manson on NBC’s Aquarius in 2015 and 2016.</span></p><span>In&nbsp;</span><span>Game of Thrones,</span><span>&nbsp;Anthony starred alongside actors and actresses such as Charlotte Hope&nbsp;</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;Richard Brake, Eline Powell and Faye Marsay.&nbsp;As a gay character, he acted sensual scenes with Sir Loras Tyrell, a role played by Fin Jones.&nbsp;Although Gethin was married, his desires on the show devolved to his partner Tyrell, with whom he has appeared equally in public.</span><p><span>His appearance in the series was not without reactions, especially from millions of LGBT viewers.&nbsp;But Anthony’s tact on set was spot on, triggering an avalanche of appreciation from viewers, particularly in the LGBT community, who now see him as a voice for their cause.&nbsp;In a 2016 interview with Dailystar, Anthony admitted to receiving several “nice letters” from his gay fans.</span></p><h2><strong><span>salary and wealth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Although no official details on his exact net worth have been released yet, it is believed that Anthony has made some significant income from his appearance in the hit TV series.&nbsp;</span><span>Game of Thrones.&nbsp;</span><span>The series has grossed approximately $2,000,000 domestically.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is he gay, who is the partner or the wife?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Although Gethin has been seen engaging in a bit of gay romance with his on-screen partner, Sir Loras Tyrell, that’s hardly the case in real life.&nbsp;He has not been seen or rumored to be dating any mysterious lady.&nbsp;Unlike most celebrities of his caliber, the England star has kept much of his love life as it should be, a personal affair.&nbsp;He has yet to flaunt any details of his love life on social media.&nbsp;However, a social media post from October 2017 had fans excited for the actor’s next move.</span></p><p><span>Gethin reportedly posted a picture with the caption, “Gethin and Cara.”&nbsp;So far, nothing has been heard from the actor about the importance of the post.&nbsp;However, there is speculation that Cara is either his partner or his friend.</span></p><p><span>If there’s something fans should pay attention to, it’s his starring role in the 2018 film&nbsp;</span><span>Dead in a Week: Or Your Money Back</span><span>&nbsp;, a Tom Edmunds film in which Gethin portrayed the character of Charlie.&nbsp;The film has received 7.9 stars out of a possible 10 from IMDb since the trailer was first released on YouTube in June 2018.</span></p><p><span>While it’s not clear where Gethin falls on the “sexual orientation spectrum,” one thing is certain;&nbsp;he hasn’t turned gay. At least not yet.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMoJytoJmjeqK606Gmp7Fdm7%2BwuYygmKadXaSzbsDHq6annaNitrR5x55koJmpYsSpu4yiqmasmJp6sa3RraWeql2kv27DyJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./xci-vs-nsp-what-is-the-difference-between-xci-and-nsp.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="XCI vs NSP What is The Difference Between XCI And NSP">&larr;
