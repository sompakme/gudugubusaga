Consequently, he can afford to lose some money on an ill-advised purchase from time to time. In 2021, the ill-advised purchase that everyone seemed to be making, was NFTs. During the 2021 crypto bull run, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">NFTs were a narrative that brought forth a whole lot of FOMO.</a> Overall, people thought they were going to become rich off of glorified JPGs that could be screenshotted. Sure, your ownership of the images would be tied to the Blockchain, however, not enough people use the Blockchain for this to have resulted in real utility.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Subsequently, the price of Bitcoin eventually crashed from $69,000 to $15,500, while <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">NFTs dove even further</a>. However, Bitcoin is now back up to $70,000 and a new crypto bull run is around the corner. As a result, some of the people who got stuck with useless NFTs are now selling in attempt to get their investments back. Unfortunately, the NFT narrative is pretty well dead as investors are putting their money into AI, Depin, and Crypto Gaming. As for Hart, he had a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT that he wanted to get rid of, and in the end, he was able to do just that.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kevin-hart-loses-on-his-investment>Kevin Hart Loses On His Investment</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The problem is that he lost over $150K in the process. According to reports, Hart purchased the NFT for over $200,000. However, when he auctioned it off, he was only able to get a grand total of $46K. This is a massive loss, although it is probably better than what he could have gotten for it a year ago. In the coming months, we imagine plenty of other artists will be looking to sell their NFTs as well. Unfortunately, they too should expect some heavy losses.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this failed investment from Kevin Hart, in the comments section down below.
