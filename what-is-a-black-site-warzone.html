It is a secret location within the game where players can participate in secret military and defense operations.</p><h3>What does Black Site do?</h3><p>Black Sites are locations that are never publicly acknowledged as existing, where secret military and defense operations, including the detention and interrogation of suspected terrorists, are conducted out of reach of the law and normal systems of oversight.</p><h3>How do you get the Black Site in warzone?</h3><p>To get a Black Site in Warzone, you need to complete a Stronghold by finding a Warzone 2 Stronghold key. These keys can be obtained by completing certain objectives or looting containers in the game. Once you have the key, you can access the Black Site.</p><h3>What is a Black Site in Call of Duty?</h3><p>Black Sites in Call of Duty games are unique spots with top-tier loot and loadouts, making them enticing for players looking for an advantage.

This can be done by obtaining a Black Site key, which is a valuable item that spawns in the game and grants access to the Black Site. It is a sought-after item and makes the player a priority target for other players.</p><h3>What are keys for DMZ?</h3><p>In DMZs, keys are special items that allow players to open specific buildings, rooms, or items. These keys are usually found by looting containers or lockers within the game.
