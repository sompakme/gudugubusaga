Cole studied photography, while Dylan focused on video game editing.</span></p><p><span>They both got back into action.&nbsp;Cole portrays series regular role Jughead Jones on the CW sitcom Riverdale.&nbsp;The role earned him his first-ever award, a Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actor: Drama.</span></p><p><span>However, Dylan deliberately chose to remain subtle in acting.&nbsp;Recent acting films include Dismissed, the independent film, Carte Blanche and the independent comedy Banana Split.&nbsp;He also had a role in the Brooklyn theater production, The Illuminati Ball.</span></p><p><span>Dylan chose to focus on his love for video games.&nbsp;He played a character in RPG and is working on his own animated fantasy series project.&nbsp;He also plays Dungeons & Dragons in a YouTube/Twitch web series.&nbsp;Dylan has also branched out into the business world.&nbsp;Along with two partners, he plans to open All-Wise Meadery in Brooklyn, NY.</span></p><h2><span>Net worth: $16 million</span></h2><p><span>During their days playing Zack and Cody, Cole and Dylan were twice, in 2007 and 2010, named the richest kids alive.&nbsp;With a combined earning of $40,000 per episode, they are also Disney TV’s highest paid teenage cast.</span></p><p><span>Their success with the series spawned the Sprouse Bros brand which they created in conjunction with Olsen Twins’ Dualstar Entertainment.&nbsp;The brand’s merchandise included comic book series, clothing lines, magazines, and more.&nbsp;The franchise was discontinued in 2008 with only the clothing line left.&nbsp;However, in March 2011, the clothing line was also discontinued.</span></p><p><span>Also Read: Bradley Steven Perry, Age, Sisters, Girlfriend, Sabrina Carpenter, Height</span></p><p><span>The twin brothers have a combined net worth of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>$16 million</span></strong><span>.&nbsp;In 2012, they bought their family a new home in Calabasas, California.</span></p><h2><span>girlfriends</span></h2><p><span>The Sprouse brothers both romanticized a number of women in the entertainment scene.&nbsp;Cole started dating Bree Morgan in 2013. They had met at NYU.&nbsp;However, they broke up in 2015. In 2017, he started dating his Riverdale co-star Lili Reinhart.&nbsp;Click here to see photos from their Hawaii getaway in January 2018.</span></p><p>Like his twin, Dylan didn’t fail to do the love department either.&nbsp;In 2014, he struck up a serious relationship with model Dayna Frazer.&nbsp;They frequently shared photos of each other on their respective Instagram accounts.</p><p><span>However, in August 2017, all hell broke loose when Dayna took to Twitter to reveal that she had found out Dylan had cheated on her.&nbsp;She wasted no time in erasing all traces of Dylan from her social activities.</span></p><p><span>However, Dylan responded in a series of tweets explaining that fans shouldn’t jump to conclusions based on the limited information they have about the cheating issue.&nbsp;He did not deny cheating, but called the case complicated.</span></p><h2><span>Cole and Dylan Sprouse Facts</span></h2><p><span>Cole was named after jazz singer and pianist Nat King Cole, while Dylan was named after Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.</span></p><p><span>Dylan is 15 minutes older than Cole.</span></p><p><span>Cole is taller than Dylan;&nbsp;Dylan Sprouse Height: 1.8m (5ft 11in), Cole Sprouse Height: 1.82m (6ft).</span></p><p><span>In 2013, Dylan was spotted working at a restaurant in New York.&nbsp;Rumors began to swirl that he took the job because he squandered his Disney wealth.&nbsp;However, Dylan immediately debunked them, explaining that he took the job to “primarily feed my excessive video game addiction” and to “try a new experience”.</span></p><p>The Sprouse brothers know how to roast themselves.&nbsp;Give them a Twitter follow for this good sibling fight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGibn6Gybq3NnWSdsZyWu26%2Fz6umrquVYq%2Bqu4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMn6minZ6ZwG6ywKagpbFdlrulecWamq2rXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./e-go-baye-e-je-speed-darlington-reacts-as-tiwa-savage-sings-about-leaked-tape-dares-her-to-r.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="E Go Baye E Je: Speed Darlington Reacts As Tiwa Savage Sings About Leaked Tape, Dares Her to R">&larr;
