It also shows the Socs as having more resources and money than the rest of humanity. -Gold: The purity, innocence, and kindness of humans are symbolised by the colour gold.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Furthermore, what are some of the slang terms used by outsiders in their conversations?</span></h3><p><span>The colloquial term for outsiders</span></p><p><span>A B</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span>Socials</span></p><p><span>The well-to-do on the upper east side</span></p><p><span>Greasers</span></p><p><span>The West Side’s impoverished children</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span>Heater</span></p><p><span>A weapon of war</span></p><p><span>Weed Cigarette</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span>What does the phrase “beefed him up” convey to outsiders?</span></h3><p><span>slang words for expressing disapproval If anything bothered him, he didn’t keep it a secret from anybody.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>There were 31 related questions and answers found.</span></h3><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Is sodapop on its way out?</span></h3><p><span>We must remember that Sodapop is merely a minor character in this novel, no matter how heartbreaking his situation seems to be. There was no genuine individual who died.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span>&nbsp;</span></h3><h3><span>Is the narrative of the outsiders based on fact?</span></h3><p><span>The Outsiders is a non-fiction work of literature. Non-fiction indicates that it is not based on a real tale, while fiction means that it is based on a genuine storey.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Who is the victim of the outsiders’ murder?</span></h3><p><span>At first, Bob Sheldon is killed when Johnny stabs him in the back of the head with a switchblade at the park (self defense). Later on, as Ponyboy and Johnny are rescuing the tiny children from a fire at the church (which was started by a cigarette), Johnny suffers terrible burns and eventually succumbs in a Tulsa hospital.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span>Ponyboy was convicted of what crimes?</span></h3><p><span>While hiding out in an abandoned chapel on top of Jay Mountain with Johnny, Ponyboy is also guilty of trespassing, which is a crime punishable by the law. Ponyboy would also be guilty of arson since it is his cigarette that ignites the fire that destroys the abandoned chapel in which he is trapped.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>What caused Dally’s death?</span></h3><p><span>He couldn’t handle it any longer.” Moments later, they get a phone call from Dally, who informs them that he has looted a supermarket shop “The police are on his trail. We have to keep him hidden. Dally was killed by police fire: an officer committed suicide.</span></p><h3><span>&nbsp;</span></h3><h3><span>When it comes to the foreigners, who are the hoods?</span></h3><p><span>Ponyboy Curtis, the fourteen-year-old narrator, has been living with his elder brothers Sodapop and Darry since their parents died in a car accident. Ponyboy Curtis is the protagonist of this novel. They are all members of the Greaser gang, which means that they are regarded as hoods or juvenile delinquents by the general public.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Are the nicknames ponyboy and sodapop appropriate?</span></h3><p><span>No, the names Pony boy and Soda pop are not nicknames; they are their real names, as evidenced by the fact that when they are at the movies with Cherry and Marcia, they inquire as to whether Pony boy is his real name, and he responds that it is, as well as the fact that Soda pop’s birth certificate has Soda pop written on it.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>What happened to the outsiders in the end?</span></h3><p><span>Tying up Loose Ends is an important step. This is a heartbreaking storey of violence, poverty, and young guys dying on the streets, and Ponyboy delivers it well. However, fortunately, The Outsiders manages to conclude on a positive note, with the majority of Ponyboy’s significant issues overcome.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span>What does the slang term “dig” mean?</span></h3><p><span>DIG is an abbreviation for “Understand” or “Enjoy, like.” So now that you know what DIG stands for – “Understand” or “Enjoy, like” – please don’t thank us for teaching you. YW! What does the abbreviation DIG stand for? This page contains the meaning of DIG as an acronym, abbreviation, or slang term.
