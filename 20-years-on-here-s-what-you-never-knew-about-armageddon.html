We can all just sit here on Earth, wait for this big rock to crash into it, kill everything and everybody we know. United States government just asked us to save the world.

"And he told me to shut the f**k up, so that was the end of that talk."</p><h3 class=article__heading>ACTING TRICK</h3><p>In one of the most emotional scenes in the movie, Harry [played by Bruce Willis] says a final goodbye to his daughter Grace [played by Liv Tyler] on a video call after he decides to stay on the asteroid to detonate the bomb.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Towards the end of the farewell, Harry starts crying. It was revealed in the DVD commentary that Willis was actually staring at pictures of his real life daughters when he recorded the heartfelt scene.</p><h3 class=article__heading>FREE TEETH</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/rb7FoOnKmgM5hclY5H_eC1ObgnQ=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/ACY7SLLBVS7EYA2CN7Q5DDXNDA.jpg"><p>Director Michael Bay wasn't thrilled by how Ben Affleck's teeth looked on camera so he decided to pay for the actor to get a new set.</p><p>Affleck had to spend eight hours a day for a full week sitting in a dentist's chair to get his new pearly whites at a cost of $20,000.</p><h3 class=article__heading>NASA MYTH</h3><p>It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that <i>Armageddon</i> isn't exactly scientifically accurate. There was a rumour that NASA used to screen the movie for their trainees who had to try to spot all 168 scientific errors in the film.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>Unfortunately, a NASA employee has since dismissed this as nothing more than an internet myth.</p><h3 class=article__heading>BAD BLOOD</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/4dwsDKcGZGaexsMYWQBXTkZeNSo=/16x25/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/PNPO6MBZNJV33ZG2KHLBH3CRMU.jpg"><p>Bruce Willis has made it clear that he didn't enjoy working with director Michael Bay. In 2007 when chatting to fans about his upcoming movie, <i>Live Free Or Die Hard</i>, Willis responded to a rumour that Bay might direct the film.</p><p>"Would have ruined <i>DH4</i> [Die Hard 4]," Willis allegedly said. "Few people will work with him now, and I know I will never work with him again."</p><p>The actor added that "a screaming director does not make for a pleasant set experience".</p><p>Michael Bay responded to Willis' comments by saying: "I loved working with Bruce. He gave me a big hug one month ago at the GM party and we talked for 20 minutes. We even talked about working together again! I mean it would be sad if he felt this way — he's never one to hide his feelings — I say sad, in that he wouldn't be man enough to say it to my face."</p><h3 class=article__heading>SORRY, NOT SORRY</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/COd9-mylhXULr8x4e7JUcK_GCTY=/16x12/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/5YFGNEJTYP4PVUEIH3XBBLGPIY.jpg"><p>In an interview with the <i>Miami Herald</i>, Michael Bay apparently apologised for <i>Armageddon.</i></p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The journalist alleged that Bay said: "I will apologise for <i>Armageddon</i>, because we had to do the whole movie in 16 weeks. It was a massive undertaking. That was not fair to the movie.</p><p>"I would redo the entire third act if I could. But the studio literally took the movie away from us. It was terrible. My visual effects supervisor had a nervous breakdown, so I had to be in charge of that. I called James Cameron and asked, 'What do you do when you're doing all the effects yourself?' But the movie did fine."</p><p>But Bay later took to his blog to say his quotes were taken out of context.</p><p>"I'm not in the slightest going to apologise for the third movie in my movie career, a film called <i>Armageddon,</i>" he wrote.</p><p>"What I clearly said to the reporter, is I wish I had more time to edit the film, specifically the third act. He asked me in effect what would you change if you could in your movies if you could go back. I said, I wish we had a few more weeks in the edit room on <i>Armageddon</i>. And still today <i>Armageddon</i>, is one of the most shown movies on cable TV. And yes, I'm proud of the movie. Enough said."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGR%2FcXnYnpirq12ku260xKucrGWnna61ediorGamlauys3nKp5ywZZGXvLbAjJqpppmXmrGlu81oj5Bqf2qfj5akkWmRenWPkYWXr4ODioBmgKJw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alana-kern-biography-wiki-age-height-net-worth-boyfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alana Kern Biography, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend">&larr;
