While playing for Detroit Pistons saw his initial rise to stardom as an MVP candidate quickly rise; how exactly was Hill different than other contemporaries on his playing style and skills?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Hill Transition From Sports To Business?</h2><p>Grant Hill did more than retire after professional basketball: after making a mark as an NBA star player, Grant launched into an entrepreneurial journey by purchasing minority stakes of the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA a mere year after retiring as player – something which not only demonstrated his business acumen but cemented his place among sports figures as one of its significant figures. What inspired Hill’s venture and has it proven so fruitful during post-NBA life?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Was Hill’s Early and College Experience Like?</h2><p>Born October 5, 1972 in Dallas, Texas, Hill had his journey beginning within a family focused on both sports and education.
