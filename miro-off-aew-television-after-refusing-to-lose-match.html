There has been a lot of speculation about Miro’s situation in AEW because he hasn’t been used much this year, and his wife, CJ Perry, formerly known as Lana, has caused <a href=#>fans to speculate about his returning to WWE.</a></p><p>Miro hasn’t competed since he, Darby Allin, and Sting defeated The House of Black at the All Out pay-per-view in September. <a href=#>Miro, as previously reported, is ready to wrestle again</a> and return to television. Although AEW has presented proposals, he did not like what was pitched and turned them down, thus AEW has kept him off television until they can agree on creative.</p><p>Dave Meltzer recently stated on <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a> that Tony Khan had a plan for him to do a match at Full Gear, but he declined. Meltzer noted that several former WWE employees are hesitant to work in AEW, making it difficult to book them if they don’t want to lose feuds.</p><p>In September,&nbsp;Tony Khan&nbsp;came to Miro, and he had this idea which would build to a match on the November pay-per-view, the November 19th pay-per-view (Full Gear), and he didn’t want to do it. It’s weird, a lot of people coming from WWE are very leery about losing.</p><p>But anyway, they went through, and now November’s over, and now we’re in the new cycle, and they were going to bring him back and try to come up with ideas for him.</p><p>And they very well may, and then his wife comes in and says, ‘Rusev Day’s gonna come back (to WWE), everybody goes back to WWE.’ It’s like, if I’m Tony Khan at this point, given everything that’s happened, and the wife of one of the wrestlers goes and says, essentially everyone goes back to WWE, it’s kinda like, ‘Why waste my time pushing this guy, I’ve got 100 guys on the roster who want to be here, and now you’ve got these guys who wanna be in WWE. A lot of the guys wanted to leave. It’s like, the guys who sign there, if they’re guys who really want to be there (in WWE), and just got fired and everything but can’t wait to get hired back. I don’t know that those guys have been that beneficial.</p><p>Meltzer also highlighted how Keith Lee and Swerve Strickland had opportunities to return to WWE, but passed them up. The former Rusev wants to&nbsp;<a href=#>win the AEW World Title in the future.</a>&nbsp;It remains to be seen when The Redeemer will finally make his triumphant return to AEW television.</p><p><strong>What do you think of Miro’s booking in AEW?
