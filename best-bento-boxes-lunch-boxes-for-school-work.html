Vegemite is thankfully still around, of course, but packed lunches have come a long way, with more exciting and nutritious options (that have nothing to do with sliced bread) and more importantly, new and improved food carriers – one of which is the bento box.</p><p>Originating from Japan, the bento box has been embraced the world over, and has revolutionised the packed lunch in the process. Designed to transport a single serve meal, traditionally for lunch, it features different sections to compartmentalise your food, keeping everything fresh and completely separate. This means you can enjoy different components to your meal such as salad, meat, veggies and chopped fruit, or even snacks to enjoy during the day.</p><p>This simple, yet over-achieving lunch box offers many other advantages. Apart from providing healthy and tasty lunch options, it helps with portion control, cuts out wasteful single-use packaging and, in these times of rising interest rates, saves on the expense of buying lunch. To top it off, they come in a wide range of stylish designs that you’d be proud to bring out in the work lunchroom.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, bento boxes have also taken off on social media app TikTok lately with over 2.7 billion views for the hashtag #bentobox and over 496.6 million views for the hashtag #bentoboxlunch. Yes, the bento box hype is real.</p><p>So once you’ve decided you can’t live without a bento box, it comes down to finding the design that suits you best. To make this a little easier, we’ve scoured the internet and found the best bento boxes for work and school including <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>the best-selling Bento Box on Amazon</a>.</p><p><span class=h2><b>SHOP BY CATEGORY</b></span></p><p><span class=h2><b id=U821948911325XtG>BEST OVERALL BENTO BOX</b></span></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Bentoheaven Premium Bento Lunch Box, $43.99 at Amazon</a></b></p><p>A number-one bestseller on Amazon, this bento box is incredibly popular.
