Unfortunately, this adventure didn’t last as long as I hoped,” he said on LinkedIn.</p><p>“At the beginning of this week they announced the need (for) a big downsizing to keep operating, laying off many capable engineers and amazing people that I have had the pleasure to work with in this short time.”</p><p>One engineering manager said he had taken the risk to take up a job at the start-up, which had 125 employees back in March 2021 with the company saying it planned to grow to 160 staff members by the end of the financial year, during a funding round where it raised $40 million.</p><p>“I was excited to join Baraja just 2 months ago. I knew I was taking a risk … to join a start-up and that it could be a rocky road and end abruptly at some point, but I didn’t expect it to end quite so quickly,” he said.</p><p>Another manager revealed he was looking to help his entire team find new roles.</p><p>“On Tuesday morning, we have been informed that there will be a significant number of redundancies. Amongst many others, also impacted by this downsizing is the entire operational team,” wrote one staff member who had been at the start-up for over four years.</p><p>“This is a call for help to my network! I have had an awesome manufacturing team here at Baraja and they are all looking for a new opportunity. A place where they can prove their skill. And believe me … There is plenty of skill to show off.”</p><p>One staff member said the cuts had even hit a university student he had hired who needed to complete practical work to obtain her degree.</p><p>He said had brought on the third year UTS undergraduate student for a six months internship – but she was only able to complete three weeks of it before being caught up in the mass sackings, adding he “felt terrible for this as I had no idea what was coming”.</p><p>A shell-shocked staffer said the good times had come to a “quick and unexpected end” and he was in disbelief at losing his job as a software architect after five years with the company, while one worker learned he no longer had a job while on holidays in Thailand.</p><p>A former employee added that “everyone can empathise that succeeding in a hardware start-up is hard at the best of times; let alone during this current climate with something that is a completely new invention – it’s a tough gig”.</p><p>The start-up had provided a range of perks to employees from a free catered lunch, a personal learning budget, emergency nanny care, “dozens of fun groups” such as soccer, frisbee and a brewing club and a personalised health and wellbeing program.</p><p>It had also attracted a range of heavyweight investors including Blackbird Ventures, Swedish company Veoneer, Japan’s Hitachi Construction Machinery and industry superannuation fund Hesta.</p><p>Baraja’s co-founder and chief executive Federico Collarte told the <i>AFR</i> that major staffing cuts had been unavoidable but the company did not take the redundancy “decision lightly”.</p><p>He added customers had slowed down the development of new vehicles amid a toughening financial outlook while manufacturing delays also added difficulties.</p><p>Staff had been cut from working on existing projects with a restructuring of its engineering teams in Australia and the United States, he noted.</p><p>The driverless technology company is the latest start-up to be caught up in the tech wreck that is smashing the sector.</p><p>Giants of the sector including <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=b90f0b5b51d788f7a86802c164934ac4 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>Amazon</a>, <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=f1ea7d81f1d263069dbdfaf22cfdef61 data-tgev-label=technology data-tgev-metric=ev>Google</a>, <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=12eb74f8c4e14923c5c1f3cab2eac4a1 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>Facebook, </a><a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=a4eb850146cf8fde08d416d5a307de48 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>PayPal </a>and <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=10d9be0e041c95033027652e4b2ba49e data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>Salesforce </a>have already announced thousands of job cuts from their workforce in recent times.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zoom joined the growing list, revealing this week it was sacking 15 per cent of its global workforce impacting around 1300 jobs as a part of a restructure.</p><p>Zoom’s founder Eric Yuan said the company’s headcount had tripled in just two years but the uncertainty of the global economy was affecting customers.</p><p>He held himself accountable for the company’s problems, adding he would reduce his salary and forgo his bonus.</p><p>“Our trajectory was forever changed during the pandemic,” he wrote in a blog post.</p><p>“We didn’t take as much time as we should have to thoroughly analyse our teams or assess if we were growing sustainably.”</p><p>Closer to home, Australian start-ups and tech companies have also had to shed their staff to survive turbulent market conditions.</p><p>The latest company to announce a “restructuring” was <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=6907cf73ddddceb30018521871c89d3c data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>comparison website Finder</a>, which laid off 15 per cent of staff across its global operations including in Australia.</p><p>Others included <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=dfba990bd53d1364a5b1b52d36c2f151 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>social media start-up Linktree</a> that was valued at $1.78 billion and sacked 17 per cent of staff from its global operations, <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=c582a96f5cc55a99962c2c79aa7033a9 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>healthcare outfit Eucalyptus</a> that fired up to 20 per cent of staff after an investment firm pulled its funding at the last minute and Indebted, a debt collection <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=891f316c53bb38c7f12d519b26f07ee5 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>start-up worth $200 million</a>.</p><p>The buy now, pay later sector has also been hard hit by the worsening financial outlook.
