When he learned the truth, Patricia did not want to know.</p><p>He said: “I felt hurt, I was a mess. It seemed my life had been a lie.”</p><p>His father Edward Fryer, whom he never met, was said to have been a talented musician.</p><p>Eric had his first introduction to music at the age of thirteen when he was given a Hoyer guitar but he found it difficult to use and refused to play it.</p><p>But it wasn't until two years later that little Eric picked it back up and never put it back down again.</p><p>Since then Eric has gone on to become one of the most acclaimed musicians of all time.</p><p>He's the only person ever to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame three times - once with the Yardbirds, once with Cream and the third time as a solo artist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000338183833.jpg><h2>What are the Tears In Heaven singer's hit songs?</h2><p>Besides his number one hit Tears In Heaven - Eric has had a slew of smash hits.</p><p>He's responsible for some of the most well-known and loved songs of all time, including -</p><ul><li>Wonderful Tonight</li><li>Layla</li><li>Cocaine</li><li>I Shot The Sheriff</li><li>Higher Love</li><li>Motherless Children</li><li>Badge</li><li>Bell Bottom Blues</li><li>White Room</li><li>Little Wing</li><li>Sunshine Of Your Love</li><li>Crossroads</li></ul><h2>Who is Eric Clapton's wife and what happened to his son?</h2><p>Eric married Melia McEnery in 2002 and shares three daughters with her - Julie rose, b. 2001, Ella May, b. 2003 and Sophie Belle b. 2005.</p><p>He was previously married to model Patti Boyd from 1979-1988.</p><p>His daughter Ruth, born in 1985, is from an affair with married studio manager Yvonne Kelly in 1984.</p><p>And he had son Conor in 1986 with Italian model Lory del Santo in an extra-marital affair.</p><p>Four-and-a-half year old Conor tragically died in 1991 when he fell from an open bedroom window from the 53rd floor of a Manhattan apartment building.</p><p>He&nbsp;had been playing a game of hide-and-seek with his nanny.</p><p>Eric only discovered the tragedy when he arrived to pick his young son up and take him to the zoo.</p><p>His hits Tears In Heaven and Circus Left Town were written about Conor.</p><p>Eric became a grandfather when his daughter Ruth gave birth to her son Isaac in 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377514044-e1515713369200.jpg><h2>What time is Eric Clapton: Life in 12 Bars?</h2><p>The documentary 'Eric Clapton: Life in 12 Bars?' will air on BBC Two at 9:15pm this evening.</p><p>The two-hour special charts the life of the iconic musician through family videos, archive footage and sets out to show what lay behind the scenes of his public life.</p><p>Included in the production is a look back on the vile racist rant he made during a 1970s gig while off his head on drink and drugs.</p><p>And there’s plenty here for the music fan to savour, with rare footage of multi-tracks being unearthed from many of his guises.</p><p>Ahead of the film’s release Eric admitted: “When I saw it I thought, ‘I don’t know if I can handle this’ — and I still don’t know if I can.”</p><p>Life In 12 Bars does not shy away from anything, or gloss over any past bad behaviour by the guitar hero nicknamed Slow Hand.</p><p>He also opens up about his heroin abuse, alcoholism, womanising, being rejected by his birth mother, the death of his son Conor and how he tempted&nbsp;model Pattie Boyd away from his best pal George Harrison.</p><p>Eric asked his good friend Lili Fini Zanuck to tell his life story without him exerting any editorial control.</p><p>The subsequent documentary shows. incredible archive footage and amazingly candid interviews.</p><p>Her film shows how the once shy “nice guy” had become a raging maniac in the mid 1970s, threatening his fans and screaming at then-girlfriend Pattie.</p><p>In a typical day he would down a bottle of cognac before lunch, then snort cocaine from a knife. In some footage he looks totally wasted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377533559.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377533544.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000235881921.jpg><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Official Trailer for Eric Clapton: Life in 12 Bars</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZGeCeoWOnqmim12YuaK806ilZqufo7S0edOemKurXZ67brTEmq2epl2ovK97</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jamie-lee-curtis-kissed-michelle-yeoh-to-celebrate-her-sag-awards-win-and-everything-else-you-di.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jamie Lee Curtis Kissed Michelle Yeoh to Celebrate Her SAG Awards Win  and Everything Else You Di">&larr;
