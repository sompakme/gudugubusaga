The West Coast native has been steadily dropping mixtapes, since 2011's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><strong>House On The Hill</strong></a>, to his most recent, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><strong>Beach House 2</strong></a>. All the while he's kept close ties with frequent collaborators like DJ Mustard, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Teeflii</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>YG</a>, and the D.R.U.G.S. production crew, who've had a hand in basically every tape from Ty.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ty has progressed along with his producers, developing a distinct, melodic sound. Ty's also turned his focus to the ladies with his two <strong>Beach House</strong> projects, which only makes sense given the smooth sounds of his voice and his r'n'b-curated beats, but that's not to say dudes can't jam out to Ty-- they can, and "Ratchet In My Benz" is the perfect example for it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><strong>Beach House 2</strong></a> was full of slow bangers, and Ty proved himself to be the star on each track, even among strong rap features and ill production. The mixtape came a day before the announcement that Ty's hard work is really starting to pay off-- <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he inked a deal with Wiz Khalifa's Taylor Gang</a>. It's definitely a good fit, with Ty's laid-back and fun-having style complimenting that of the TGOD crew.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With Ty on the brink of becoming something huge, now's the time to get familiar. We decided to chop it up with Ty and producer Buddah Shampoo (who is in the D.R.U.G.S. collective Ty often works with) for this edition of <strong>Track Breakdown</strong>. The two made a dope collaboration, alongside <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Juicy J</a>, with "Ratchet In My Benz."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">We found out how Ty got Juicy J on the track, what Buddah Shampoo was doing the day he made the beat, how the two first connected, Ty's studio essentials and more in this exclusive.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Listen and download the song in question below, then click through the images above to learn more about it.</p><p><br><h2>FROM TY DOLLA $IGN'S PERSPECTIVE</h2></p><p>Talking To Ty Dolla $ign & Buddah Shampoo On "Ratchet In My Benz"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>On how the idea for “Ratchet In My Benz” come about:</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One day I just had this girl in my Benz and we got ratchet [Haha]…&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>On how he connected with Juicy J for the track:</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">I was in studio with Wiz [Khalifa], Juicy happened to be there and I was like, ‘Yo, I got this record I think you'd be crazy on’.
