Created by The Haunting of Hill House director Mike Flanagan and based on the Christopher Pike novel of the same name, The Midnight Club follows a group of &nbsp;terminally ill youth living in hospice, who meet every night and swap scary stories. Beyond the club's stacked cast of newcomers and rising stars, the series also depicts each of the young patients' creepy tales, meaning there's plenty of room for Flanagan's favorite actors to make appearances. Read on to meet the actors and characters.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-club><span>The Club</span></h2><h2 id=iman-benson-as-ilonka-3>Iman Benson as Ilonka</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hruG29E56sJLggCorf24KV-1920-80.jpg><p>Ilonka's world is rocked when she's diagnosed with thyroid cancer, which disrupts her senior year and her plans to attend Stanford. She discovers Brightcliffe while researching cures and treatments, and enters the program to investigate an mysterious past case where a resident walked out with a clean bill of health.</p><p>Atlanta native Benson started out as a child actress, making her television debut alongside Nia Long and Mike Epps in the 2016 sitcom Uncle Buck. She also starred in Kenya Barris' Netflix comedy #BlackAF, and the streamer's teen sitcom Alexa & Katie.&nbsp;Her next project is a new film adaptation of War of the Worlds, where she'll star alongside Ice Cube and Eva Longoria.</p><h2 id=ruth-codd-as-anya-3>Ruth Codd as Anya</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ceY4ESRF6u5cRGeR48dLec-1920-80.jpg><p>Anya, Ilonka's new roommate at Brightcliffe, was born in Ireland and is a lower-leg amputee. She's nihilistic and holds everyone at a distance, but she cares more than she lets on.</p><p>Codd is best known for Tik Tok, where she had 672,000 followers, shared funny stories about her life growing up in Ireland, and spoke candidly about her disability. She worked as a barber and make-up artist before she joined the cast of The Midnight Club with no prior acting experience (she's since deleted her Tik Tok). After her stunning performance as Anya, the newcomer will appear in Flanagan's next show, The Fall of the House of Usher.</p><h2 id=igby-rigney-as-kevin-3>Igby Rigney as Kevin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kCm2r2dpfdQDzHspY5FcaU-1920-80.jpg><p>Kevin is the first kid Ilonka meets at Brightcliffe, who's been there for four months and was diagnosed with Leukemia. He's charming and loves music, and the duo become fast friends.</p><p>Rigney made his Flanagan-verse debut in <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a37809743/midnight-mass-cast-netflix/>Midnight Mass</a>, where he played teenage altar boy Warren Flynn.

The Statesville, North Carolina, native previously starred in Midnight Mass as Leeza, the devout teen who received one of the show's first miracles. She also previously acted in the 2021 film Caged.</p><h2 id=william-chris-sumpter-as-spencer-3>William Chris Sumpter as Spencer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8CKVqeRStDDF25GUCcghvi-1920-80.jpg><p>Sumpter plays Spencer, a gay man who has HIV and faces daily stigma because of public perception about the disease in the '90s. Spence is the warm life of the party, who sees the Midnight Club as his found family.&nbsp;</p><p>The 20-year-old actor got his start in musical theater, joining the Broadway production of Matilda at age 11. He's also starred in the dance film NYC Dreams, and appeared in the STARZ hit Power as Young James "Ghost" St. Patrick.</p><h2 id=adia-as-cheri-3>Adia as Cheri</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/afqZktJFRRdQNFMHTh3YTF-1920-80.jpg><p>Cheri is a member of the Midnight Club who "rides for free" because she's afraid to share stories in the early episodes. She's loving and caring, but she's also known for her fantastic, unbelievable anecdotes about her life before Brightcliffe. The Midnight Club is Adia's first-ever role.</p><h2 id=aya-furukawa-as-natsuki-3>Aya Furukawa as Natsuki</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vWnZUBjmXkYg3xDBdiqzhA-1920-80.jpg><p>Natsuki is a Brightcliffe patient who prefers horror stories and often holds her emotions under the surface.

Sapkota is another newcomer making his television debut in The Midnight Club, and he'll join Codd, Rigney, and Furukowa in The Fall of the House of Usher.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-hospice><span>The Hospice</span></h2><h2 id=heather-langenkamp-as-dr-georgina-stanton-3>Heather Langenkamp as Dr. Georgina Stanton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wPKxdZLneeyPSehkwh3Hqe-1920-80.jpg><p>Dr. Stanton is the kind and empathetic head of Brightcliffe, who founded the hospice after losing her son to a long-term illness. She doles out both wisdom and tough love to the young patients, though the caretaker also seems to be keeping secrets about the hospice's mysterious history.</p><p>Langenkamp is a horror legend, who's best known for playing final girl Nancy Thompson in the&nbsp;A Nightmare on Elm Street&nbsp;franchise. She has also acted on the '80s sitcoms Just the Two of Us and Growing Pains, as well as the film Star Trek Into Darkness and the Ryan Murphy anthology American Horror Story: Freak Show.</p><h2 id=zach-gilford-as-mark-3>Zach Gilford as Mark</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YjPv9fbBXrYgVF4hkBRXYQ-1920-80.jpg><p>Gilford plays Mark, a nurse practitioner at Brightcliffe who deeply cares for the patients and is always upbeat, though sometimes corny. The actor previously starred in Midnight Mass as Riley Flynn, and he's also known for his roles on the series Friday Night Lights, Parenthood, and Good Girls. He'll also appear in The Fall of the House of Usher.</p><h2 id=matt-biedel-as-tim-3>Matt Biedel as Tim</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bnCfnqA3vd9SNDo4RuFKYb-1920-80.jpg><p>Ilokna's supportive foster father Tim is played by Biedel, another Flanagan alum who portrayed Sturge in Midnight Mass. The actor has appeared in dozens of television series, with his other Netflix credits including Altered Carbon, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/umbrella-academy-season-4/>The Umbrella Academy</a>, Narcos: Mexico, and the forthcoming The Fall of the House of Usher.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-flanagan-favorites><span>Flanagan Favorites</span></h3><h2 id=samantha-sloyan-as-shasta-3>Samantha Sloyan as Shasta</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r65zzqv4iPLWjmvzkJwP9b-1920-80.jpg><p>Shasta is a naturopathic healer who lives near Brightcliffe Hospice.

Sloyan is best known among Flanagan fans for playing Bev Keane in Midnight Mass, and also played Leigh Crain in The Haunting of Hill House. Meanwhile, Shonda Rhimes fans will recognize her as Dr. Penelope Blake on Grey's Anatomy and Jeanine Lock on Scandal.

Kohli acted in the series iZombie and Supergirl before his star-making turn as Owen in The Haunting of Bly Manor. He worked with Flanagan again on Midnight Mass, playing the kind Sheriff Hassan. And yes, he'll also appear in The Fall of the House of Usher.</p><h2 id=henry-thomas-as-freedom-jack-3>Henry Thomas as Freedom Jack</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K7rWC4HA5TgtXgUCgA6iL4-1920-80.jpg><p>Thomas, who appears in Natsuki's story in episode 8, is a longtime Flanagan collaborator.
