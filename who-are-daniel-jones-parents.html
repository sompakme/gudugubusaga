He is a quarterback in the National Football League.</p><p dir=ltr>He's the oldest son of Becca and Steve Jones. He has an older sister, also named Becca, who played field hockey at Davidson College, a younger brother, Bates, who plays basketball at Davidson, and a younger sister, Ruthie, who plays soccer at Duke</p><p dir=ltr>After redshirting his first year at Duke in 2015, Jones became the starting quarterback in his sophomore season in 2016 starting all 12 games. Next year, he was phenomenal en route to 2,439 yards, and twelve touchdowns and was named MVP of the 2017 Quick Lane Bowl. During his senior year, Jones was named the MVP in the 2018 Independence Bowl. He later played in the 2019 Senior Bowl for the North team and was also the MVP of that game. Jones graduated from Duke University in December 2018 with a degree in economics and declared for the 2019 NFL Draft.</p><p dir=ltr>The New York Giants selected the Duke product with the sixth overall pick in the 2019 Draft. Seen as the successor to the legendary <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eli Manning</a>, Jones’ tenure has been solid, if unspectacular.</p><p dir=ltr><a href=#>Daniel Jones</a> was seemingly ready to contribute from the get-go, but he was a backup at first. Three weeks into the season, however, it was time for Manning to slowly ride off into the sunset, while Jones was the starter. It was not ideal, as the Giants were very bad in his first three years. Jones showed some potential, but he did not show enough for the organization to exercise his option for the fifth year of his rookie deal. Jones clearly took that as motivation; after three losing years in a row, Jones led the Giants to a 9-7-1 record and their first playoff berth since 2016.</p><p dir=ltr>Jones then put forth a terrific performance in the playoffs against the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Minnesota Vikings</a>, going on the road and putting forth one of the best performances of his career in a victory. While the Divisional Round showdown against the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Philadelphia Eagles</a> didn't go well at all, this was still a major step forward for Jones.</p><p dir=ltr>Daniel was born to Becca and Steve Jones in May 1997. While there is not a lot of information on Jones' parents, we know that they are very supportive of his football career.</p><p dir=ltr>The couple gave birth to three other athletic freaks. The eldest, Becca, played field hockey while she was at Davidson College. Meanwhile, Bates played basketball while he was at Davidson College. The youngest, Ruthie, plays soccer at Duke University, ensuring that all siblings are attached to sports.</p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Daniel Jones' Parents</figure><p dir=ltr>Becca Jones, the mother of Daniel Jones, has a long history with Davidson, resulting in three of her children also joining the university. Becca graduated from the Queen's University of Charlotte with a degree in Spanish and literature with a grade of 4.0 in 2008.</p><p dir=ltr>Prior to that, she earned her political science degree from Davidson in 1985. Becca works as a translator and tutor for Charlotte-Mecklenburg School. She started her career at the school 9 years ago.</p><p dir=ltr>Becca has reiterated several times how attending the games was never a burden but was more of a fun experience.</p><p dir=ltr>While most expect their parents to be their biggest believers, in the case of Daniel, the case was quite the opposite. His dad, Steve Jones, had doubts about whether he would ever become a football player. But, it wasn’t a lack of belief but more of seeing Daniel associated with basketball instead of football.</p><p dir=ltr>Papa Jones certainly doesn't mind that his son proved him wrong, as he has now become a star player in the NFL. The pair, Steve and Becca, make sure to travel to MetLife Stadium now and then to cheer for their son as he is working to cement a legacy of his own in the NFL.<strong><br></strong></p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Daniel Jones' Family</figure><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Daniel Jones' Family</figure><h2 id=daniel-jones-parents-faq>FAQs</h2><h3 class=faq-question-element readability=-1>Q.
